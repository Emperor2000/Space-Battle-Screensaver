**Space Battle Screensaver | Space Combat Engine**
-------------------------------------------
**What is this all about?**
"Space Combat Engine", formerly "Space Battle Screensaver" is an extension/project written on top of Game Maker Studio 2 with a focus on being able to create a game that requires multiple factions and large battles.

-------------------------------------------
**How is this achieved?**
Each class contains a number of properties. You can easily add new functionality by editing the base class or creating a child object of the base class, which you can then edit. This way you can create new unique objects in a matter of minutes. For example, adding multiple types of enemies, new factions, etc.

I have tried to make the code as easy to understand as possible and as easy to edit.

**Can I use this?**
You are allowed to use this tool for:

-Creating a game in Game Maker Studio 2 (or studio 1.4).
-Commercially or non-commercially selling a game that you developed using this extension.

-------------------------------------------
You are not allowed to:
-Redistribute the source code, commercially or non-commercially in any way, shape or form.
-Include this source code in another package.
